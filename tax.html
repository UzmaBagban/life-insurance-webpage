                    Tax impacts of lease accounting change

                    <p>
                        On 9 August 2016, HMRC released a consultation document to flag some potential tax impacts that
                        a
                        forthcoming change in
                        lease accounting may have on the funding of plant and machinery. From 2019, lessees using IFRS
                        (including FRS 101), as
                        opposed to FRS 102 (UK GAAP), will no longer have to distinguish between finance and operating
                        leases. All leases
                        (except some small value leases or very short leases) will be capitalized on the lessee’s
                        balance
                        sheet at the NPV of
                        the future payments from the day the lease starts. This accounting change will not affect
                        lessors.
                        At the moment, the
                        tax treatment typically depends on whether a lease is a ‘long funding lease’ or not. If it is,
                        then
                        it is the lessee who
                        gets capital allowances (CAs). However, much anti-avoidance legislation is focused on the
                        concept of
                        finance leases and
                        the IFRS change will interfere with that. In its consultation, HMRC has floated four options for
                        addressing the issue.
                        The first is broadly the status quo, with some tinkering. The others contain the more radical
                        suggestion to move towards
                        an accounts-based regime for taxing leases, using a system of debits and credits somewhat akin
                        to
                        the loan relationship
                        regime and which would similarly eliminate the capital/revenue divide. ith such a proposal,
                        including:

                    <p>
                        HMRC has identified several issues which should be addressed in conjunction with such a
                        proposal,
                        including:

                        <li>
                            <p>Can HMRC trust companies to use ‘sensible’ depreciation policies or will there
                                need to be
                                legislation for it?</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>In order to avoid distorting the ‘lease or buy’ decision, the government may be
                                willing to offer
                                an enhanced deduction to lessees that would otherwise have qualified for the AIA.</p>

                        <li>
                            <p>Could HMRC combine an accounts-based regime with giving the lessee an option to
                                claim CAs on the
                                ‘right of use’ asset?</p>
